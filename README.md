# Python Toolbox

A number of small modules and functions that we found useful over time:
- deep_dict: Support for deep dictionaries (such as configurations)
- config: Flexible application configuration
- logging: Small extension to logging
- git_utils: Few utilities to help with using git in your application
- import_modules: Dynamically load (user provided) python files from outside the project
- FileRepo: easily open and cache cloud-files, files in tar, tar.gz, zip or git-repos, etc.


# Examples

TODO
The [Jupyter notebook](url) has a number of examples
